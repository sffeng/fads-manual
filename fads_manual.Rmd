# Welcome to FADS
Welcome to the FADS (Feng Applied Data Science) research group in the Mathematics Department at Khalifa University of Science and Technology (Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates). I'm Samuel Feng, and this manual provides expectations and important information for anyone getting started with my research group. I hope it saves you some frustration and pain throughout your academic journey.

This manual is modeled after [Mariam Aly's lab manual](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual) after I read [this inspiring article](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-06167-w). 

**Starting Jan 1, 2020, all FADS members need to have printed and signed the FADS agreement**


# FADS principles, expecations, and responsibilities

## Everyone

Applied mathematicians often deal with frustrations. From many angles. You'll be one figure away from a paper for months. It might seem like nobody else in the world (even me) understands the struggles of your work. At the same time, our research can be one of the most fulfilling activities you'll ever do.

### *One principle to rule them all*

Team FADS wants everyone to have a positive, supportive, hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding environment. To this end, there is one main rule:

 - **Work with integrity.** We all want to publish amazing papers and do amazing things, but this is worthless if accomplished through unethical means: plagiarism, tampering with data, making up data, omitting results, or fudging results. Science is about discovering truth, and mathematical scientists are especially responsible for pursuing truth without compromise. There are no second chances in academia when it comes to academic misconduct, and any will result in immediate termination from FADS and escalation to the relevant authorities. Some other items on this list can be bent or broken, but this is the one rule that you can *never* break. 

### *Other major principles*

After this rule come a set of important rules for all FADS members:

 - **Work passionately.** That is, Work on what you are passionate about, or at least work on developing that passion. 
 - **Let your work and ideas shine.** Too many KU students want to suppress themselves (e.g. "I'm not good enough" or "My work will bring others down"). This is self-condemnation, not humility. Be proud of your work (some boasting is OK).
 - **Celebrate each others' success.** Don't be jealous when someone else is proud of their work, but be proud that they are proud! We are not in competition with each other, and one member's success is the group's success.
 - **Don't rush.** Dr. Sam struggles with this. Good science/mathematics/statistics requires *careful* progress. Think about every step. Double and triple check before showing others. Think about extreme and simple cases. Ask others to look at code snippets that aren't behaving properly. Mistakes are ok, except those due to rushing and carelessness. This usually means to *not put things off until the last minute*.
 - **Own your mistakes.** If you make a mistake, immediately alert anyone who could be affected (collaborators and Dr. Sam). This is especially important if we are already writing the paper. We'll correct the mistake, and the work moves on.
 - **Acknowledge knowledge gaps.** If you don't know something, ask! Some of the worst situations come from a student pretending to know something they don't. Nobody's education is perfect, and the vast majority of what you learn in formal education is re-learned during the research process. Also check the FADS wiki for FAQ and relevant resources.
 - **Support each other.** Listen to someone vent. Ask someone to look at your code. Research is collaborative, not competitive.
 - **Respect your fellow FADS team members.** Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Respect their culture, religion, and habits. They may need you to be quiet.Sarcasm, pranks, making fun, and "playful banter" are usually not a good thing (there are much better ways to enjoy humor with each other).
 - **Do not hide tension or hostility.** Something must be done immediately. Intellectual research cannot thrive in the presence of disrespect and rudeness. This won't always result in a "happy solution for everyone" but it is preferable to bullying or seething.
 - **Tell Sam issues you have with him.** The previous point applies especially with Dr. Sam.
 - **Read the scientific literature.** When you start I'll try to have all members reading at least one paper, but eventually you'll want to keep up to date yourself.
 - **Take care of your life outside of work.** 
 
### *Smaller things*
- Full time members (not undergrads during courses) should be accessible on Slack (see below) on Khalifa University working days between 9am and 5pm. That means excluding weekends and holidays.
- Full time members should be physically present on campus (i.e. available for meeting) on KU working days between accessible on Slack (see below) on Khalifa University working days between 9am and 5pm.
