# FADS Research Group Manual
Manual for students, research staff, and trainees in Samuel Feng's research group.

# Hello!
It looks like you have joined (my) Sam Feng's FADS (Feng Applied Data Science) research group in the Mathematics Department at Khalifa University of Science and Technology (Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates). 

This manual was inspired by [Mariam Aly's lab manual](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual) after I read [this inspiring article](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-06167-w). It is a work in progress (previous versions are accessible through GitHub). If you have ideas, comments, and concerns about this manual's contents, please contact me.
